## Note

I use free OpenVPN configuration file from this site https://www.vpngate.net/en/ </br>
I am not sure how long it will work with the free ovpn file. It's better to update ovpn files with your own ovpn.
</br></br>

## Instruction to update server list:
1. Replace/add your .ovpn file with <b> assets/</b> directory .ovpn file
2. Now go to MainActivity.class and find the "getServerList()" method there you have to update server information.
3. [!Optional] At Last go to SharedPreference.class and find the "getServer()" method there update default server information.
